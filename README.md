Lecture notes for the talks of David Nadler at the [MSRI summer school "New Geometric Techniques in Number Theory"](http://www.msri.org/summer_schools/680).
These notes are in a very rough state and probably contain many errors.
If you want to know what Prof. Nadler actually said, go [watch the videos](http://www.msri.org/people/4514).
